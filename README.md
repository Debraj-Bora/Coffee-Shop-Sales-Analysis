# Coffee Shop Sales Analysis
## Project Background
This project focuses on analyzing the sales data of a Coffee Shop, using transactional records from various store locations. The goal is to derive insights into customer purchasing behaviour, revenue trends, product performance, and store effectiveness. By understanding these patterns, we can identify opportunities for improving sales strategies, optimizing inventory, and enhancing customer engagement.

## Executive Summary
The analysis is based on transactional data that includes product details, revenue figures, and store locations. This dataset has been visualized in a Power BI dashboard to uncover key insights regarding sales performance, customer preferences, and store profitability. The findings indicate that revenue generation is influenced by product category, store location, and seasonal trends. Additionally, sales data show patterns that can help in inventory management and marketing strategies.
